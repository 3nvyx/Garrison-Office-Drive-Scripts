This is a script I made to process student data for my school adminstration job. 
100% Google Apps Script/Javascript. 

It would process student data and classifiy which 18 honor societies the student qualify for;
a process that mannually take 5-30mins per person- reduced down to 30 seconds.

Main file is in Student transcript Processing and Apps Script Code.
